# Deprecated concept with disallowed annotations or axioms

**Problem:** A deprecated concept includes class annotations or axioms which are not allowed.

**Solution:** Remove any disallowed annotation properties or axioms from the deprecated concept.

**Further information:**

Deprecated concepts can only contain certain annotation properties and axioms, as defined [here](https://edamontologydocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developers_guide.html#deprecating-concepts).
